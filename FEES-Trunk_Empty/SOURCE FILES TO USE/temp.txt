The \textit{Flexible Experimental Embedded Satellite} is a 1/3 U Cubesat for in-orbit technology demonstration and validation. It was scheduled to be launched in the first trimester of 2020, but because of COVID-19 has been re-scheduled for second trimester of 2021. Mission main objectives are to space-qualify the attitude determination and control sub-system (developed by a Politecnico di Milano master of science thesist) and to test in LEO a radiation-sensitive experiment (developed by a Phd thesist of the University of Brno).

Secondary objectives are the validation and in-orbit use of particular GPS receivers, the testing of the LoRa module as a valid alternative for communication with the ground stations, the testing in space of an experimental solar panel by Centro Elettronico Sperimentale Italiano \textit{CESI}, the validation of the IRIDIUM module and all the components of the platform itself, since it uses non radiation-hardened, commercial components on board.

Tertiary objectives are the validation and in-orbit use of Two-dimensional PSD by \textit{Hamamatsu Photonics} and two bolometers (instruments for measuring total electromagnetic radiation, at all frequencies), 4x16 IR arrays by \textbf{Melexis} for accurate earth-sun position determination and finally the utilization of a raspberry pi camera to take some pictures of earth from LEO and beam them down with the next downlink. 

FEES is a collaborative project and its development involves private companies and universities. The injection in a sun-synchronous orbit of 575 km altitude will be ensured by \textit{Unisat-7}, a secondary payload of a Soyuz/Fregat flight. FEES will start its activities only 30 minutes after deployment in orbit, as required by launcher rules in order to not disturb launcher's operations.
The software will be structured as a finite state machine, as described in the following chapters, in order to ensure such requirement and to regulate its behaviour during all phases of its mission.
The modes the spacecraft will enter in will depend on the phase of the mission, mode definition and mission requirements will be discussed further on in this paper. \\

This Spacecraft has been designed as a 1/3 U cubesat for costs reasons primarly, to also allow for cheap constellation making possibility for future innovative in-space communication techniques (like lasers or others) , multi-device multi-vehicles testing and for future projects including thethers.



The link-budget for communication from and to ground is of interest to evaluate the overall energy use of the spacecraft, it also has to be approximated in excess in order to be on the safe side and avoid to launch a satellate doomed to be DOA (dead on arrival).

The power budget is also of special interest because of the battery limited capacity and the small solar panels size.
